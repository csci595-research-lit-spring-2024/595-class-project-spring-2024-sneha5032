Twitter has become a crucial medium for people to use their smartphones to provide real-time views of events in the context of modern disaster communication. The difficulty, therefore, lies in programmatically separating the language used in tweets to convey metaphors from actual news of calamities. In order to determine if a tweet is indeed connected to a crisis, this study presents a machine learning algorithm. The suggested approach uses a painstakingly hand-classified dataset of 10,000 tweets and combines vectorization, classification, and NLP models to improve prediction accuracy. By tackling the challenges presented by metaphorical language, this research helps to construct a sophisticated machine learning framework that can determine the genuine nature of tweets connected to emergencies.
